# Utility_Models 1.1.0

MATLAB functions for fitting intertemporal choice (ITC; aka delay discounting) models or risky choice models to choice data.
Generally, running single parameter models are recommended (e.g., exponential or hyperbolic ITC models, or all risky choice models).
Two-parameter models, such as the generalized exponential, generalized hyperbolic, and quasi-hyperbolic models are implemented but
the parameters can be hard to identify and often run into reasonable parameter bounds. Use with caution.
